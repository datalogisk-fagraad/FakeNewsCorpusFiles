# Fake News Corpus Files
These are files intended for the [Data Science][2] module at University of Copenhagen. The content is a subset of the [Fake News Corpus][1]. These files are only meant as a help so you don't have to download the whole dataset (about 30 GB unzipped) in order to start working with it.


## Files
* [`1mio-raw.zip`][4]: Contains the first 1 mio. articles in Fake News Corpus unaltered. About 1.15 GB big.
* [`clean-100k.zip`][5]: Contains the first 100k articles in Fake News Corpus cleaned. About 134 MB big.


## Cloning the Repo
This repo uses [Git Large File Storage][3]. You need to have this installed on your system to clone the repo successfully. To install:

```
$ git lfs install
```

Alternatively, you can simply download the files directly from the website.
